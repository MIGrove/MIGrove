- 👋 Hi, I’m Matthew, a software engineer and uni. student studying Computer Science and Astronomy!
- 👀 I’m interested mostly in Networks and Embedded Software, and in my free-time I like to make weird little physics and economics simulations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the ModBus and DNP3 protocols for embedded devices used by grid utility companies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... nothing atm. Maybe in future? :P
- 📫 How to reach me: Shoot me an email! matthewigrove@proton.me
