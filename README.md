Hello, I’m Matthew. I work with embedded Linux systems and grid utility applications.

A bit about what I do:
- ⚙️ I’m currently interested in real-time operating systems.
- 🪐 I enjoy making wacky little physics simulations (astronomy!).
- 🌐 I'm busy working on trying to implement a collection of networking protocols for some new hardware.

If you'd like to work with me on something new, shoot me an email.
