- 👋 Hi, I’m Matthew, a Software Engineer working on embedded Linux systems!
- 👀 I’m interested mostly in Embedded Software and Simulations, and in my free-time I like to make weird little physics and economics simulations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the ModBus and DNP3 protocols for embedded devices used by grid utility companies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... nothing at the moment. Maybe in future?
- 📫 How to reach me: Shoot me an email! matthewigrove@proton.me
